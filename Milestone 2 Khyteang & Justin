What I did?

From our last milestone, we were able to import the images out of the planetcute library and onto the screen. We were able to move the character using the arrow keys.
However, we had a problem because when we import the background with the character, they both moved together and our goal is to have only the character moves.
We fixed this problem during milestone 2 and we actually created the whole stage. 
The goal of this game is to collect as many keys as possible within a limited time.
So what we have so far is a working gui with a background that allows the player to move the character around the screen without going out-bound.
Also, when you click the "space" bar the key will automatically move to a random place on the screen. 

What am I working on?

The next step would be to make the key automatically go away when the character steps on it. 
Also, we will like to incorporate obstacles so that the player cannot just move the character in anyway possible.
This will add some difficulty for the player.
