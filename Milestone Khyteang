What I did?

I was able to use the images from the planetcute library and make a scene out of the images. 
I was able to put the scene onto a gui that our game will display on.

Codes:

#lang racket

(require 2htdp/image)
(require 2htdp/universe)
(require 2htdp/planetcute)


(define (stack imgs)
  (cond [(empty? (rest imgs)) (first imgs)]
        [else (overlay/xy (first imgs) 0 40
                          (stack (rest imgs)))]))

(define img (beside/align
   "bottom"
   (stack (list wall-block-tall stone-block))
   (stack (list stone-block stone-block
                stone-block stone-block))
   water-block
   (stack (list grass-block dirt-block))
   (stack (list grass-block dirt-block dirt-block))))

(define window (empty-scene 500 500))


(define (scenes imgs) ;t =WorldState
  (place-image img (car imgs) (cdr imgs) window)
)

(define (change w a-key)
  (cond
    [(key=? a-key "left")  (cons (sub1 (car w)) (cdr w))] 
    [(key=? a-key "right") (cons (add1 (car w)) (cdr w))] 
    [(= (string-length a-key) 1) w] 
    [else w])) 

(big-bang '(253 . 354) 
          (to-draw scenes) 
          (on-key change))
